Reservoir Sampling

Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing k samples from a list of n items,
where n is either a very large or unknown number.

Typically n is large enough that the list doesnâ€™t fit into main memory. For example, a list of search queries in Google and Facebook.

So we are given a big array (or stream) of numbers (to simplify),
and we need to write an efficient function to randomly select k numbers where 1 <= k <= n.
