Compute Single Source Shortest Path (Bellman Ford's Algorithm)

Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph.

The graph may contain negative weight edges. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and time complexity is O(VLogV)
(with the use of Fibonacci heap). Dijkstra does not work for Graphs with negative weight edges, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs.

Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems. But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE),
which is more than Dijkstra.
